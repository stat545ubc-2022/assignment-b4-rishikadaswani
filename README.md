## Main Features 
Feature 1: Images for improvement of aesthetics 
Feature 2: Slider Bar - for interaction with the plots 
Feature 3: Check boxes - for users to select specific species and island 
Feature 4: Plots- scatter plot and histogram 


## Additional Features 
Feature 5: Select Input - in order for users to see pictures of each species 
Feature 6: Individual tabs for each component (scatter plot, histogram and data table)
Feature 7: Download Button to allow users to download the dataset for manipulation 
Feature 8: Interactive data table - allows users to search and sort data as they see fit
Feature 9: Improvements to aesthetic and display 

## Acknowledgements 
This app is created using the `palmerpenguins` package which includes data collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The dataset is available to download in this repository and can also be downloaded by loading the package directly.
